Hello! My name is Keith Murray and I am a current MEng student at MIT studying Computation and Cognition. Check out some of my projects involving *deep learning*, *dynamical systems*, and *neural computation*. I'm particularly proud of the `neural-rules` repo. 

You should also take a peak at my [website](https://www.mit.edu/~ktmurray/index.html)...
